Prism Lights is a project that changes the Philips Hue Light experience. Our applications on iOS and Android devices allow users to interact in new ways with their Hue bulbs. From controlling bulbs manually to automating the lights with schedules, room tracking, and interactive music, Prism Lights allows users to interact with their lights in useful and fun ways.
